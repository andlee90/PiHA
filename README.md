# PiHA --- Pi Home Automation
Pi Home Automation. A simple client-server application designed to allow network-based control of various residential electronics using both an Android device and a Raspberry Pi.

PiHA is the current iteration of a project (SRAS) that was developed by Andrew Smith and Timothy Kelly as part of a summer internship at East Stroudsburg University under the guidance of Professor Haklin Kimm.

The ultimate goal of PiHA is to provide a smoothe Android application for interfacing with an array of PiHA servers, each running on a Raspberry Pi 3. Users will be able to gain quick access to these servers in order to issue commands to the devices each server is responsible for hosting.

The devices currently planned for include: LEDs, RGB LEDs, Relay Modules & Stepper Motors. These devices can then be used to interface with a number of hosusehold appliances, including lamps, outlets and blinds.

PiHA is utilizing the following technologies: Java SE 1.8, Android 8.0, Xerial Sqlite-JDBC 3.20.1, Pi4J 1.1 & Raspbian 4.4.49 running on a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B.
